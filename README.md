About:
  Budget Envy is a budgeting tool modeled after the envelope system in which a
  person would put cash into an envelope for a particular item or type of item
  and then not spend money on that item outside that which was set aside into
  the envelope.

Instructions:
  * Login as a guest to play around with the buttons and see how the program
    looks and works.
  * As a logged in user, first create a budget, and then the main envelopes that 
    you will need using the big blue buttons on the left. Then customize as
    necessary with the buttons on the envelopes themselves.
    
Technology Used:
  * Ruby version 1.9.3
